Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition, check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following are merely guidelines. They include herbs offered on our websites. This list does not help with administering information on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine. This needs to be discussed with your physician. <br>Should I check with my doctor or healthcare provider before using a supplement? This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Dietary supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.<br><br>Reversals and Chargebacks<br><br>We consider Chargebacks and reversals as potential cases of fraudulent use of our services and/or theft of services, and will be treated as such. We reserve the right to file a complaint with the appropriate local and federal authorities to investigate. Be advised that all activity and IP address information is being monitored and that this information may be used in a civil and/or criminal case(s) against a client if there is fraudulent use and or theft of services.<br><br>Customizing Orders<br><br>Customer satisfaction is our main priority, and we are always interested in making our customers' experience with our products enjoyable and convenient. If you would like to request custom arrangements for your account, such as bulk orders, and/or ordering additional products, just call our customer service representatives and we will be happy to discuss your account with you. We cannot accommodate every request, but we do our best to accommodate where possible. To ensure the highest quality customer care, and to be sure that your order is handled correctly, your call will be recorded and archived for future reference.<br><br>Representations<br><br>You hereby represent and warrant that: <br>1.
